## LAMP Stack on Ubuntu 20.04
This guide documents how I set up a LAMP stack on my Ubuntu living in a virtualbox on Windows10

It was majorly a 4-step process. Which are:
1. Installing Apache and updating the firewall
1. Installing MySQL
1. Installing PHP
2. Creation of Virtual Host for your website.

### Prerequisites
You'll need to have an Ubuntu 20.04 server with a non-root sudo-enabled user account and a basic firewall.
